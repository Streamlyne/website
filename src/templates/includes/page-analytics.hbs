              Streamlyne helps identify root problems and predict the likely chain of events leading up to a potential failure. Streamlyneâ€™s algorithms help detect sensor trends that cause a ripple effect by detecting anomalies that could affect safety or operations.

            <p>
              As our platform consumes more data, it becomes extremely valuable to control room operators and managers. Every operator interaction, data point, alert, sensor value, and event helps train our custom algorithms and analytics engine to be more intelligent and automatically learn how your plant operates and thinks.
