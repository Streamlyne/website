            <h3>Reduce Downtime</h3>
            <p>

            <h3>Operator Knowledge</h3>
            <p>
              Operator knowledge is now documented and built into each sensor alarm and our predictive analytic algorithms. Streamlyne ensures DCS systems gather experiential information from experienced employees so that decades of “know-how” simply doesn’t walk out the door and leave the company. A catalogue of knowledge is built to benefit new employees and help them do their jobs better.

            <h3>Decrease Emissions &amp; Penalties</h3>
            <p>
              By providing diagnostic information, operators can act quickly and identify problems before they escalate. This decreases product waste, improves safety, and decrease overall emissions. Not only is this beneficial for the environment and surrounding communities but it decreases costly penalties.

            <h3>Increase Safety</h3>
            <p>
              Streamlyne’s capabilities will help empower control room operators with the ability to view upcoming critical situations and increases their decision making timeframe. Pre-emptively detecting events help improve safety as it avoids fast, reactive, and hesitant decisions that can lead to worker groups being put in harmful situations.
