          In one glance, visualize a real-time ripple effect of any major or minor event in your plant. Streamlyne’s interactive graph’s allow you to drill-down and easily view what alarms and sensors are involved with an unplanned downtime event.

        <h2>Flare/Product Off Spec Event - Prediction</h2>
        <p>
          It’s simple for a control room operator to trace and monitor an event. As you can see in the flare example, there are four (4) levels of sensors involved in this ripple effect. The first major node identifies a possible downtime event (off-spec product), and the operator can drill down to the 2nd node (PV123 or Sensor 1), 3rd node (TT432l), and 4th node (TI07) of sensor data to diagnose the impending event. Now, the operator can easily make the adjustments in their DCS to the correct settings.

        <h2>Key Stats</h2>
        <p>
          Easily visualize key stats and the probability that a downtime event will potentially occur, with key information such as Set Point and Deviation. In this example, the data and visualization shows that there is a prediction of 65% that a flare or product off spec event will likely occur.
