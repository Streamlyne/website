            <h3>Predictive Analytics</h3>
            <p>
              Streamlyne's technology helps managers and control room operators to predict current DCS alarms and sensor data to recognize critical events (off spec product, flaring, hydrates, plant shutdowns, pipeline leaks, etc.) before they happen.

            <h3>Cloud or On Premise</h3>
            <p>
              Streamlyne was built to harness the power and processing of the cloud. Our infrastructure is built on top on world leader, Amazon Web Services (AWS); however, we recognized that some companies prefer to installed on premise. Streamlyne can easily accommodate
              both cloud and on premise installation.
