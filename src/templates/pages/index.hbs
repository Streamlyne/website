    <div class="">
      <p>Today your plant is humming along, but on the night shift a critical component malfunctions or completely fails. As a result, your plant shuts down for emergency repair. How much will this cost? Do you have the extra parts on hand? How many employees does this affect? How does this affect your output and timelines? The unknown can be scary and costly. Streamlyne gives you the ability to be proactive by giving your operators and managers the alerts needed to prevent reactive consequences.</p>

        <p class="text-danger">Last month, our plant had a major “blockages” and “equipment failure” and if we had Streamlyne it could’ve predicted and helped prevent 3 days of downtime which cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
