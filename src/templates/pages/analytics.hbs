		<p>Streamlyne provides alerts and analytics to help operators and managers make decisions that reduce costs, eliminate operational downtime, and improve ROI of their operations. Begin understanding your plant in new ways as Streamlyne collects and analyzes daily information from your systems to identify anomolies that may be devastating to your plant. When something goes wrong and a critcal alert happens operators need to act immmediatly to solve the problem. Streamlyne analyzes millions of data points and presents operators with potential solutions to the alert and reasons why the alert happened.

				<h3>Alerts</h3>
				<p>Streamlyne is constantly reading and analyzing data through our algorithms to alert you before things go wrong. Instantly be alerted when assets are reaching maximum or minimum thresholds, the probabilities of malfunction, and the liklihood of a negative event happening. You can also see what other assets may be affected to monitor them as well.

				<br/>
				<br/>

				By integrating with your DCS, when an alert goes off Streamlyne receives the same alert in real-time. Streamlyne then analyzes each alert in combination with millions of data points, presents the reasons for failure, and then the recommended solutions. You can add new solutions, values, and numbers to various problems and solutions at anytime.

			<h3>Predictive Asset Failure</h3>
			<p>
			An Operator wants to monitor the health of an Asset over the course of a year.
			Operators can create a scenario with conditions that our Streamlyne Analytics system will automatically evaluate throughout the day.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
			Streamlyne will tell the Operator the potetntial date when it will fail and probability of the scenario occuring.
			When viewing an existing Scenario you are presented with a graph representing the trends of DCS sensor data that can help an Operator identify Asset malfunction.

	      <div class="">
	        <p>As our platform consumes more data, it becomes extremely valuable to operators and managers. Each additional data point, alert, solution, recommendation, and user action makes our algorithms and analytics engine more intellegent and automatically learns how your plant operates and thinks. </p>

	      <h3><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>  Predictive Analytics</h3>
	      <div class="">
	        <p>Our unique machine learning and artificial intelligence approach detects potential alerts and failures minutes, days, weeks, and months before they happen. Streamlyne helps identify root problems and predict the potential chain of events leading up to a failure to help minimize unplanned downtime.</p>

	      <h3><i class="fa fa-code-fork"></i>  Scenario Builder</h3>
	      <div class="">
	        <p>Operators have the ability to build custom scenarios, intelligent rules, and direct relationships to assets and sensors. Operators use their knowledge of the plant to build specific parameters and conditions that will help monitor and predict failures. Build your scenarios and watch analysis in real-time.</p>

	      <div class="">
	        <p>Structuring plant data efficiently helps operators to query and access information with ease. Important questions require complex analysis and data to identify correlations, causal relationships, and present inferences in easy to use formats. Real-time insights made simple for operators and managers.</p>
