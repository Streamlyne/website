<h3>iOS application for iPhone and iPod touch</h3>
<p>Streamlyne offers a native iOS application for both iPhone and iPod that allows everybody in your plant to access and input critical asset information anywhere, and anytime. Whether you want to view a CAD file, view key metrics, enter data on assets, or view lock-outs/ blinds procedures, you can do it all with Strealyne’s easy to use application.

<h3>Desktop Web Application</h3>
<p>
This is the administration and creation hub of Streamlyne. Managers and VP’s can view all operator information, but can also create reports, lock-outs, blinds, procedures, and metrics. View your custom dashboard to see alerts, trends, scenarios, and updates to know exactly what is going on in your plant as it happens.

<h3>Asset Profile</h3>
<p>The core functionality of Streamlyne is providing critical information linked to an individual asset in order to build a profile specific to that asset.</p>
<p>The user could view:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metrics and trends</li>
<li>Lock-out Tag-outs and Blinds</li>
<li>Work Orders</li>
<li>Timeline</li>
<li>Operating Parameters</li>
<li>CAD’s (p&amp;ID)</li>
<li>Procedures</li>
<li>Groups</li>
</ul>

<h3>Metrics</h3>
<p>
As an operator, you can easily build a custom metric data sheet to track data and trends, upper and lower specs, and important information on various pieces of equipment.
<br/>
As assets are monitored and data is input, you can now build a history on any piece of equipment or process over time.

<h3>LOTO &amp; Blinds</h3>
<p>
An operator can easily create Lockouts and Blinds in the web application, input all required steps and then seamlessly distribute to all operators throughout the iOS mobile and web platforms. This is a great tool to standardize processes throughout all plants.
<br/>
An operator can simply search Streamlyne for the asset and create/view the Lockout and Blind and follow the required steps while in the field.

<h3>Work Orders</h3>
<p>
Streamlyne integrates with all major Asset Management Systems (IBM Maximo, SAP, Oracle, Open Text) and allows you to pull all work orders for that specific asset. This allows you to see the history of maintenance and recent activity around each asset.

<p>
Your timeline is a snapshot of what has happened from shift to shift among employees. It allows employees to communicate and comment on recent asset activity.

<h3>Operating Paramters</h3>
<p>
Assets come with specific OEM (original equipment manufacture) specs but in reality, equipment specs change without notice or the ability to log changes. Operators will be able to set the OEM values and then input ongoing values over time. This contributes to data history and overall metrics which can be tracked over long periods of time for increased plant intelligence.

<h3>CAD (P&amp;IDs)</h3>
<p>
We see this as a new way of navigating assets. Streamlyne makes CAD files mobile and interactive so they can be viewed in real time. Click on CAD files to bring up asset profiles, log sheets, work orders (from Asset Management System), procedures, lockout/blinds, DCS trends, and groups. Within two clicks an operator can have all their daily workflow and real time information at their fingertips on iOS mobile devices (currently iPhone/iPod).

<h3>Procedures</h3>
<p>
Procedures are linked to their specific CAD files to ensure fluidity and connectivity across the platform, allowing users to access all asset information at any time from any location.
