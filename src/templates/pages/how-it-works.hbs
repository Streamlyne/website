<h3>Deployment</h3>
<p>
So, how does Streamlyne work?

We take all the raw, unstructured, user generated data from three separate silos: 
Asset Management Systems (IBM, SAP, Oracle, OpenText); 
Distributed Control Systems (Invensys, Honeywell, Siemens) 
Operator user generated information/input
We then take this complex data and run it through Streamlyne’s Custom Analytics Platform and generate simple and user-friendly graphic images that display new trends and analytics for operators and managers.

VP’s and Manager  Capabilities
Now VP’s and managers can view all system and user generated information - for one or multi-site plants.

Operator Capabilities
Operators now have a user-friendly iOS mobile application so they can view and input real-time asset information right at their fingertips.
