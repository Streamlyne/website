        <h3>Employees/Operators App</h3>
        <p>
          We make 3D/2D CAD files interactive and all your manufacturing operations information available within a couple of clicks. It?s that simple and easy. Here?s what a typical daily routine of most employees and operators at manufacturing plants who work with 3D/2D CAD files looks like. If employees want information it?s usually in many locations spread across their operation. Employees try to find their CAD file and print it off, search through filing cabinets for paper drawings, carry around huge paper manuals, print off long procedures, and then once they get to their location they stand there wondering what to tackle first. Sound familiar. The Streamlyne Employee/Operator app will bring this entire process into one easy to use and beautifully designed application. With two or three clicks, you will have all this information ready to use and make your employees daily workflow and job more productive.

            <h3>Annotations</h3>
            <p>
              Streamlyne has solved the clutter problem and makes it simple for employees to add unlimited annotations to any part or component in a 3D/2D CAD file. When adding annotations to 3D/2D CAD diagrams, it can get extremely cluttered with many text boxes, contrasting colours, and becomes difficult to view detailed information and CAD diagrams. Employees and managers can easily add video, voice, and text annotations directly in your 3D/2D CAD diagrams and process flow diagrams and share them with anyone in your company.

            <h3>Asset Management System Integration (Work Orders)</h3>
            <p>
              Employees use complicated and time consuming paper processes to submit maintenance and repair work orders. We easily integrate with major Asset Management Systems such as IBM Maximo and SAP. With one click, an employee or operator can search any 3D/2D CAD file and view complete work order history for a specific component or part, add a work order to Maximo or SAP, and view other key information as required. For example, an employee needs to change the oil on compressor. They can search for that CAD file, view the work order history, and then submit an order to Maximo or SAP. It?s that easy.

            <h3>Maintenance and Repair</h3>
            <p>
              The worst thing that can happen to a manufacturing operation is for there to be a shutdown or downtime. Streamlyne easily provides employees with specific maintenance and repair information on how each component is put together with accompanying 3D/2D CAD files, procedures and manuals for reference on how to fix the issue, and ability to submit simple work orders.  Having quick and easy access to this information in one platform allows for quick equipment repair turnaround and increased production.

            <h3>Manuals</h3>
            <p>
              Our platform will take all of the large, complicated manuals and make them available instantly to employees on the plant floor. No longer will there be a need to flip back and forth through giant paper manuals searching for specific details. Employees will be able to easily search and find what they need, when they need it. For example, if an employee is working in a large area and needs a manual for a specific part or component, they could simply search for that area and Streamlyne would present all relevant manuals and specific details. It?s that simple.

            <p>
              We make is really easy for employees/operators to search, view, and interact with any 3D/2D CAD file that you work with on a daily basis. Employees can search for anything in a CAD file, such as: parts, components, text information, specific areas, and that information will be presented. Imagine standing in front in front of a maze of large maze of pipes at an oil and gas plant, assembling the wing of plane, or building an automobile. You carry around mountains of papers CAD files to find what you?re looking for or assembly. Using Streamlyne, you simply search the CAD file for what you want and we present information you need.

              Whether it is a new hire or a 30-year veteran, employees need to know how their company expects them to do their job. Streamlyne provides employees multiple ways to easily search for any procedure they require to do their job. You could simply search for the procedures by name, or search for the 3D/2D CAD file component and with one click you will be presented with the procedure for that specific part, component, or area. Employees will have instant access to all of the company?s procedures and instructional content at their fingertips. This will help employees work faster and ensure all quality and compliance standards are met.
