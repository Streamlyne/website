<p>Streamlyne's features were developed in collaboration with operators to help simplify their daily workflow and tasks. Operators have a tough job and process critical amounts of information at all times. Streamlyne makes it simple for operators to have access to all their key tasks and information in one location. As operators perform their tasks, they generate real-time data that contributes to the Streamlyne Analytics platform to help operators predict and prevent unplanned downtime. Our operator features compliment current IT systems and can easily interface to current applications and pull infomration into our platform.</p>

<h3>Mobile Application</h3>
<p>Streamlyne offers a native iOS mobile application for the iPhone/iPod that allows operators to view and input critical asset information and analytics anywhere in your plant. Whether you want to view an asset profile, navigate a P&ID CAD file, view key metrics, enter data on assets, or view lock-outs/ blinds procedures - you can do it all with Streamlyne’s easy to use application.

<h3>Desktop Application</h3>
<p>
This is the administration and creation hub of Streamlyne. Managers and VP’s can view all operator information from the plant floor from one plant or multi site operations. Operators can create reports, build lock-outs/blinds templates, create and view procedures, and build custom metrics to track anything in your plant. Operators can easily monitor their dashboard to see alerts, trends, scenarios, and updates to know exactly what is going on in your plant. All features created in the desktop application is seamlessly pushed to the mobile application so you can use in the plant.

<h3>Asset Profile</h3>
<p>Streamlyne allows an operator to search and view key asset information within two clicks - it's that simple. Streamlyne connects and pulls data from many sources so operators can view and interact with one comprehensive asset profile. Imagine an operator or maintenance worker having this information at their fingertips right in front of an asset.</p>
<p>An operator can view:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metrics and trends</li>
<li>Lock-out and Blinds</li>
<li>Work Orders</li>
<li>Timeline</li>
<li>Operating Parameters</li>
<li>CAD’s (P&amp;ID)</li>
<li>Procedures</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6">
<h3>Metrics</h3>
<p>
As an operator, you can easily build custom metric forms to track and trend key data for anything in your plant. For example, if you want to monitor and measure the visual wear and tear of an asset, simply use the metric template builder and input the parameters you wish to analyze. Using the mobile application, operators will find it valuable to use up-to-date metrics while doing their rounds and maintaining assets. Overtime, as assets are monitored and more data is input, you can build a history on any piece of equipment or process.

<div class="col-md-6">
<h3>LOTO &amp; Blinds</h3>
<p>
Streamlyne's Lockout/Blind system is an innovative tool that lets you standardize this complex processes throughout one or multi site plants. An operator can easily create Lockouts and Blinds for any piece of equipment, input step-by-step lockout processes, attach isolation points, and ensure all compliance rules are followed. Once a Lockout/Blind has been created, it can then be seamlessly distributed to all operators and maintenance personell through the mobile and web platforms.

<h3>Work Orders</h3>
<p>
Streamlyne integrates with all major Asset Management Systems (IBM Maximo, SAP, Oracle) and allows you to view the history of maintenance and recent activity for each asset. Operators can easily add photos and comments to assets that have been fixed or update other workers on what activity has been completed on that asset. Streamlyne's mobile application lets operators and manintenance view any work orders in their plant or out in the field.

<div class="col-md-6">
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>
Your timeline is a snapshot of what has happened from shift to shift and collection of key activities that you need to know about. It allows operators, maintenance, and managers to communicate and comment on recent asset activity, downtime, plant performance, and analytics. Most plants operate on shift work such as "x" amount of days on and "x" amount of days off. When an employee returns from their time off, Streamlyne makes is simple to review their timeline and be up to date on all operations while they were gone.

<h3>Operating Paramters</h3>
<p>
Assets are supposed to be operated within specific OEM (original equipment manufacturer) specs and requirements. In reality, operators and maintenance personell change settings all the time based on many factors. Using Streamlyne's mobile application, operators will be able to input and analyze changes in operating parameters over time. As data is collected, operators and maintenance can measure the impact any change in settings has on the overall health and useful life of that asset.

<h3>CAD (P&amp;IDs)</h3>
<p>
Streamlyne gives operators a new way of searching and navigating assets. Streamlyne makes CAD files interactive on our mobile application so you can view asset information in real time. For example, you're standing in front a maze of pipes or large compressor - you can simply search for that CAD, click on that compressor to view its: asset profile, metrics, work orders, procedures, lockout/blinds, and DCS trends.

<div class="col-md-6">
<h3>Procedures</h3>
<p>
Operators and Maintenance are overloaded with the volume of technical documents and detailed procedures they have to learn and have immediate access when they need it. Today, this is a painful process of printing large volumes of paper and detailed drawings and trying to interpret while in the field or working on an asset. Streamlyne allows operators and maintenance to simply drag and drop any document or procedure and attach it to an asset. Upload thousands of documents and procedures and have access to them anytime, anywhere. For example, you need to fix an asset. Streamlyne makes it simple to locate all information - search for PV123, review the lockout/blinds, review the procedure how to fix it, and you're done.
